            <b>Note:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I've brought this exercise back a little to where we are not showing the Search Component, the Product Details,
                    nor the one second incremental count. The Product Summary List is still present along with the Add to Cart
                    button associated with it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <b>Task:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use Redux (<a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/" target="_blank">http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/</a>)
                    to manage the filtering and display of products based upon category. Do not worry about the Add to Cart
                    button at this time (hide it if necessary).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To get us to a more React/Redux implementation, generate Presentation Components by creating new
                    components or refactoring existing components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've gone ahead and defined your actions (/exercise/actions/index.js). You need to generate your Action Creators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've gone ahead and combined your reducers (/exercise/reducers/index.js). You need to build the
                    products and productFilter reducers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've gone ahead and outlined your container (/exercise/containers). You need to finish them out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you have completed that, in your exercise.js file you need to create the store and apply the Provider.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <b>Bonus:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Apply the Add to Cart functionality and generate a HeaderContainer to display the Header text and total cart items
                </li>
            </ul>
